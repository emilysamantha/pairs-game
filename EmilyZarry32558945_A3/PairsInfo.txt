	Pairs is a card game that utilizes a triangular deck of cards which contains 
	1-1, 2-2s, all the way to 10-10s - making up 55 cards in total. Pairs can be 
	played by up to 8 players. 

	The target score for each game depends on the number of players following the 
	formula (60 ÷ number of player) + 1. The target score for 7 and 8 players are
	kept at 11. Below are the target scores for each number of players.
		Players:	2	3	4	5	6	7	8
		Score:		31	21	17	13	11	11	11

	The game starts by dealing each player a card from a shuffled deck. Five cards 
	are set aside (burned) face down from the deck to form the discard pile. The 
	player who is dealt the lowest number will take the first turn. If two or more 
	players are tied, deal a new card to each player to break the tie. If a player 
	is dealt the same number (i.e., receives a pair), the player should discard it 
	and deal another card.

	On each player's turn, they can choose to either hit or fold. 

	~  If a player chooses to hit, they will draw a card from the deck. If the 
	   player draws a card with the same number they already have, they will 
	   score points equal to the number they matched. Otherwise, the turn goes 
	   to the next player.
	~  On the other hand, if a player chooses to fold, they will take the lowest 
	   card on the table and score points equal to the number they took.

	The end of a round is signified when a player either draws a pair or chooses 
	to fold. When a round ends, the players discard all cards except for the cards 
	used to track points. Then deal another round of cards to each player and
	resume the game, with the player who deals the lowest number going first.
	
	If the deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile, and use that as the 
	new draw deck. Each time the cards are reshuffled, burn five cards to the 
	discard pile.

	The goal of Pairs is to keep your scores low as to not reach the target score. 
	The first player who reaches the target score loses the game.
